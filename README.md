# motor ðŸ›ž
A custom motor controller design based on the STSPIN32F0.

The documentation is included to justify and explain design descisions. I also tired to make everything general enough that you could spec your own controller with the process I used.

The schematic needs a few test points and LEDs but everything crucial is there.
