    "Its an IC designed for BLDC motor controller with a bunch of helpful features for our controller.\n",
    "* It is based around a [STM32F031C6](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f031c6.html) which is an easy to work with, high-performance MCU\n",
    "* Its operating range is 8V to 45V which matches our 40V target\n",
    "* It has built-in 3 phase gate drivers which can source/sink 600mA at 12V making it easy to drive big power mosfets\n",
    "* It has a built-in boostbuck converter and LDO for powering external devices and gate drivers saving regulation circuitry\n",
    "* It has timers we can use to read quadrature encoders\n",
    "* It has built in Op-amps and ADCs for the current sensing required for FOC\n",
    "* It has a USART interface so we can talk to it\n",

    "## Guides\n",
    "A lot of the entires in the STSPIN datasheet are a little vague. I've found that the eval board [STEVAL-SPIN3201](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-spin3201.html) and the guides associated with hit have helped a lot. The guides in particular go over crucial details about layout and component selection that will become important later.\n"
